I'm creating this app to show ferry departure times and weather forecast for those departure times in a single location.

my python code is connected to a csv file which contains ferry schedule data.  If the ferry schedule changes, I will add a new csv and connect to that instead.

 **This weather data is collected from Visual Crossing ([visualcrossing.com](https://www.visualcrossing.com))** 
    to provide weather forecasts for each ferry departure on the Bell Island - Portugal Cove route. Select a Day and Location
    and the weather data will update for each scheduled departure. The app contains weather for 7 days.
    
    **Disclaimer:**
    - Weather data is rounded to the nearest hour and may not be precise or up-to-the-minute.  
    - This is a general guide. Please check the marine forecast below and the NL ferry schedule for updates or changes.
